# FUNAGING.CLUB — SYSTEM RULES (SOURCE OF TRUTH)

1. No STEP is considered DONE without:
   - Browser Proof (URL + render)
   - Health check passing

2. No code change without:
   - New STEP number
   - ONE PACK execution

3. Docker Engine must be running before any ONE PACK.
   - If Docker not running → FAIL immediately.

4. GitHub is the Source of Truth.

   - Every STEP must be pushed to remote.

5. Baseline once frozen:
   - Cannot be modified
   - Only extended via new STEP
